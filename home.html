                <h3>Early Careers</h3>
                <i id="icons" class="bx bxs-briefcase-alt-2"></i>
                <p>
                    One of the first jobs I landed was face-to-face sales. Then I
                    resigned wanting to explore other aspects of sales. Then Lamudi
                    Philippines recruited me and there I learned to do telephone sales.
                    I stayed there for a year then quit and came back again as a Team
                    Leader and have stayed in there for more than 2 years. It is one of
                    the most memorable experiences where I learned so much not just
                    selling but also an opportunity to manage people. An opportunity has
                    opened and I was Sprout Solutions which is a SaaS company that
                    provides automated solutions for HRs - stayed the for a year until I
                    left for Canada.

                <i id="icons" class="bx bxs-right-arrow-square"></i>
                <p>
                    It was that we had an opportunity to study in Canada. And with the
                    influence of my two brothers who are both successful software
                    engineers in the Philippines sparked my interest in pursuing
                    software development. An opportunity to work with one of the best
                    tech companies in my country made me realize how impactful
                    technology advancement is, it promotes efficiency and accuracy and
                    then the question pop up in my head on how can someone make such
                    precise and effective applications.

                <h3>As a student</h3>
                <i id="icons" class="bx bxs-book-content"></i>
                <p>
                    As a student again? Of course I thought that I was done with this
                    phase of my life, it never crossed my mind that I was going to be in
                    this position again. It is a rollercoaster of being fun and tiring
                    at the same time to be a student. More so you have to adjust to a
                    world that you have no idea about or are used to. But, I already did
                    it right? I already have a full experience on how to become a
                    student and all I have to do is to bring back my learner's mindset.
                    And, so I focus, remain patient, and become a sponge. It's going to
                    be hard at first but I know that this will all be worth it!.

                <p>
                    I'm going to be in a cozy room, sitting with my laptop, typing away.
                    Mastering software development, one line of code at a time. With
                    each project completed, I'm gonna build my confidence, and with
                    proper determination to succeed I'm going to make it. My goal is
                    simple and was clear: to become a skilled developer and create
                    software that would make a difference in people's lives.
